# Proposal
For our project, we will be collecting our own data, based on the Kaggle dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/alyeasin/predict-pizza-price?select=Pizza-Price.csv). We will be investigating pizza prices in Newark, Elizabeth, and Union, New Jersey, and predicting the price of pizza given an input of desired toppings and size.  This project is interesting because of it's relevance to the NJIT student body, as most students on campus consider cost when ordering food.
In order to collect our own data, we will use tools such as Yelp and Google Maps to find information on pizza restaurants in the locations mentioned above. We will use the restaurant website to look up prices, or call the restaurant ourselves. We will investigate the cost  of one small cheese pizza, one small pepperoni pizza, and one small "specialty" pizza. A specialty pizza is a pizza with four or more toppings, and is associated with the particular restaurant. We will also record the diameter of the pizza, which we will use to help find which pizza is the most cost efficient. We will repeat this for the other locations as well.
